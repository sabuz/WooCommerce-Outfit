Want to know how your customers are doing with the sold products? Want to engage your customers more? The WooCommerce Outfit plugin is going to help you find all those answers, but before that, you have to understand what is Outfit. 
When a potential buyer buys a product and uploads a picture of him/her using that product, showing satisfaction or gratitude is known as Outfit.

This will not only engage your old customers but also will generate potential customers.
