== Description ==
Want to know how your customers are doing with the sold products? Want to engage your customers more? The WooCommerce Outfit plugin is going to help you find all those answers, but before that, you have to understand what is Outfit.

When a potential buyer buys a product and uploads a picture of him/her using that product, showing satisfaction or gratitude is known as Outfit.

Your sold products review is going to be on your website with a less effort from you rather your customers are going to give more efforts to upload photos of your product by using the WooCommerce Outfit Plug-in.
